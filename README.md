# small-office-vlan-dhcp-lab
Hands-on Cisco Packet Tracer lab simulating a small office network with VLANs, DHCP, and inter-VLAN routing.
## ðŸ§  Project Overview
This lab simulates a **small office network** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It demonstrates how to separate departments using **VLANs**, configure **DHCP** on a Cisco router, and enable **inter-VLAN routing** for communication between networks.

âœ… **Skills Demonstrated**
- VLAN creation and switch port management (Layer 2)
- Router configuration for multiple subnets (Layer 3)
- DHCP address assignment and troubleshooting
- Inter-VLAN routing and connectivity testing
- Network documentation and verification commands

ðŸ§© **Tools Used**
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco 2811 Router & 2960 Switches
- Windows PCs for testing and verification

This is my first published networking lab and part of my ongoing journey toward mastering network infrastructure and cybersecurity fundamentals.

## ðŸ‘‹ About Me
I'm an aspiring **Cybersecurity Analyst** and **Network Technician** building hands-on labs to strengthen my technical foundation.
