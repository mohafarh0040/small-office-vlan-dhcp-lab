## üß† Project Overview
This lab simulates a **small office network** using Cisco Packet Tracer.  
It demonstrates how to separate departments using **VLANs**, configure **DHCP** on a Cisco router, and enable **inter-VLAN routing** for communication between networks.

‚úÖ **Skills Demonstrated**
- VLAN creation and switch port management (Layer 2)
- Router configuration for multiple subnets (Layer 3)
- DHCP address assignment and troubleshooting
- Inter-VLAN routing and connectivity testing
- Network documentation and verification commands

üß© **Tools Used**
- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Cisco 2811 Router & 2960 Switches
- Windows PCs for testing and verification

## üßæ IP Addressing Scheme
| VLAN | Department | Subnet | Default Gateway | DHCP Range |
|------|-------------|---------|-----------------|-------------|
| 10 | IT | 192.168.10.0/24 | 192.168.10.1 | 192.168.10.10‚Äì192.168.10.50 |
| 20 | HR | 192.168.20.0/24 | 192.168.20.1 | 192.168.20.10‚Äì192.168.20.50 |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Router Configuration (Key Commands)

```bash
interface fa0/0
 ip address 192.168.10.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
!
interface fa0/1
 ip address 192.168.20.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
!
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.10.1 192.168.10.9
ip dhcp excluded-address 192.168.20.1 192.168.20.9

üß™ Connectivity Test

All PCs successfully obtained IP addresses via DHCP and communicated across VLANs.

‚úÖ VLAN 10 PC0: 192.168.10.11 ‚Üí Gateway 192.168.10.1 ‚Üí Success
‚úÖ VLAN 20 PC2: 192.168.20.10 ‚Üí Gateway 192.168.20.1 ‚Üí Success
‚úÖ Inter-VLAN ping: Success after ARP resolution (0% packet loss)

## üëã About Me
I'm an aspiring **System Administartor** and **Network Security Engineer** with a strong interest in practical, hands-on learning.  
I enjoy building and troubleshooting real network environments using tools like **Cisco Packet Tracer**, **Kali Linux**, and **VirtualBox**.  

Currently, I‚Äôm developing my technical foundation through certifications such as **CompTIA Security+**, **Network+**, and **Cisco CCST**, while creating personal labs to strengthen my understanding of **network infrastructure** and **cyber defense fundamentals**.  

Each project I post on GitHub represents a step toward mastering **real-world IT and cybersecurity skills** ‚Äî from networking basics and scripting to ethical hacking and system hardening.
